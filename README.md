# I Choose You: Pokemon Battle Simulator

## Description

"I Choose You" is an interactive Pokemon battle simulator that allows users to test their Pokemon knowledge and battle skills. As a Pokemon trainer, users can choose their Pokemon, battle against friends or a computer opponent, and track their wins. The game features an introduction, Pokemon selection, battles, and a leaderboard to compare performance.

As young adults, we donâ€™t have the time nor energy to play countless hours of pokemon on console, and thus the pokemon battle simulator was birthed to remind ourselves of our youth.
